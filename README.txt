Vision
------
Slideshow is a javascript class for Mootools 1.2 to stream and animate the presentation of images on your website. Slideshow is the result of many trials in code attempting to create a javascript class that was lightweight, unobtrusive, a snap to setup (but also highly configurable), extendable and - built using the javascript framework with the best effects - visually very impressive. Slideshow began as a side project by Aeron Glemann, and is now open source with an MIT-style license. If you would like to contribute - improving the class in accordance with the aforementioned goals - please contact a developer for membership. 

Features
--------
Many revisions later what Slideshow has lost in slimness it has gained in robustness and features:

Dynamic resizing - Slideshow can accommodate any size presentation.
Thumbnails - intelligent, auto-scrolling, tracking, etc.
Full-featured controller - completely style-able with CSS.
Animated captions - plain text or formatted with HTML.
Fully accessible - Slideshow can be controlled with access keys.
Automagic slideshows - create slideshows from existing HTML images.
Varied hyperlinking options - Slideshow allows for mashups with Lightbox, Slimbox, etc.
CSS slide transitions - designed in stylesheets, not javascript, allow for an infinite combination of effects (plus support for all Robert Penner transitions).
Unobtrusive and degradable - Slideshow even functions with Javascript turned off!
